nse-generator
=====================

A very simple way to generate very simple nmap scripts that makes it very easy to do basic research or just poke around at the internet

Currently it will generate a script to scan for a chosen port, tcp or udp, and output a list of found ips open, closed or filtered, one per line, more customization to come.

TODO:

add much more customiation options
put the base script into another file
general improvements
